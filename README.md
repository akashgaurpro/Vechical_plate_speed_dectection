# Vechical_plate_speed_dectection
<h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT -</h2>
<p>Now a days we hear news about accidents on Highways very frequently. And in most of the cases main reason of accident is over speed. Although all highways do have signboards indicating maximum speed limit for the sake of driverâ€™s safety, but still people does not obey highway speed limit. Our proposed project aims to develop a system that detects vehicles driving at speeds over specified limit and inform concerned authorities immediately. Road accidents occurrences have increased recently so there needs to be a system that allows to detect over speeding vehicles.</p>
