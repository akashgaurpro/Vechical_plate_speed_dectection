# Vechical_plate_speed_dectection
<h1 style="padding-left:50px;">PROBLEM STATEMENT -</h1>
<p>Now a days we hear news about accidents on Highways very frequently. And in most of the cases main reason of accident is over speed. Although all highways do have signboards indicating maximum speed limit for the sake of driverâ€™s safety, but still people does not obey highway speed limit. Our proposed project aims to develop a system that detects vehicles driving at speeds over specified limit and inform concerned authorities immediately. Road accidents occurrences have increased recently so there needs to be a system that allows to detect over speeding vehicles.</p>
<p>whereas this proposed system does not need any human interception and 
records car speed as well as wirelessly informs authorities of over speeding detections. Methods used include roadside speed traps set up and operated 
by the police and automated roadside 'speed camera' systems which may incorporate the use of an automatic number plate recognition system.</p>
